## Overview

BreachLens is an advanced automated breach data analysis platform that helps organizations identify, categorize, and respond to data breaches efficiently. By leveraging automation and data intelligence, BreachLens provides actionable insights to enhance cybersecurity posture.

## Inspiration

The increasing frequency of data breaches has created a pressing need for efficient and scalable tools to analyze compromised data. Inspired by the challenges cybersecurity professionals face in identifying, categorizing, and responding to breaches, we set out to create a solution that leverages automation and data intelligence. Our goal was to provide a streamlined platform that not only detects vulnerabilities but also generates actionable insights for organizations to enhance their security posture.

## What it does

Our project, BreachLens, simplifies the complex task of analyzing breached account data. Key features include:

* **Automated Data Processing**
    * Extracts and categorizes accounts by domains, IPs, applications, and more
    * Process millions of breach entries efficiently
    * Real-time data parsing and analysis

* **Advanced Tagging System**
    * Tags domains for attributes like security status
    * Accessibility verification
    * Parked domain detection
    * Application type identification

* **Security Analysis**
    * CAPTCHA and login form detection
    * Real-time domain status verification
    * Identification of security vulnerabilities

* **Breach Intelligence**
    * Matches domains against known breached data
    * Historical breach correlation
    * Risk level assessment
